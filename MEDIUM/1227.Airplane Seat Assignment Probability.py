##n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:

##Take their own seat if it is still available, and
##Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied
##Return the probability that the nth person gets his own seat. 
class Solution:
    def nthPersonGetsNthSeat(self, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 1:
            return 1.0
        else:
            return 0.5
